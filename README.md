## Tune the Baseline Trading Algorithm


Step 1: Tune the training algorithm by adjusting the size of the training dataset.
Answer the following question: What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing the training window?

Step 1 Answer (a): From decreasing the training window to ["2015-01-21":"2018-08-22"], 
	the data has shown an increase to Accuracy from 0.55 to 0.56
	

Step 2: Tune the trading algorithm by adjusting the SMA input features.
Answer the following question: What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing either or both of the SMA windows?

Step 2 Answer (b): From increasing the values of the short window from 4 to 8,
	the data has also increased its Accuracy from 0.55 to 0.56
	the recall score for True Positive buy signals has achieved 1.00 while the sell signals scored 0.00
